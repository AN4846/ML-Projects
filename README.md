# ML-Projects
These are a couple of Machine Learning projects conducted during my MSc.
Code was developed in Google Collab and the following notebooks are present:
1) Predicting customer purchase intention. Individual project with the task being to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on a set of predictors. KNN, SVMs, and Random Forest Classifiers were utilized.
2) Traffic sign recognition: Group project where I led my team in running a Neural network to determine what type of traffic sign an image belongs to.
